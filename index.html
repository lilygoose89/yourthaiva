      Pang has assisted me with various tasks relating to my Thai corporation,
      property and several other matters. I would be completely lost without her
      as she provides terrific services in a timely and reliable manner. She is
      absolutely the best go-to person I know of in Thailand.

      Having somebody I can rely on when I've got too much on my plate helps me
      to focus on what I do best - providing great service to my own clients. I
      know I can trust Pang to take care of the day to day work that would
      otherwise overwhelm my focus. I'm lucky to have stumbled upon somebody so
      thoughtful and professional.

      marketing and graphic design. She thinks outside of the box and made my
